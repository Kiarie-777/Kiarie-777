## 🚀 Projects I'm Proud Of

### 📦 AgriSphere – E-commerce App for Farmers  
Built a mobile platform using Kotlin and Firebase to help farmers procure farm inputs efficiently. Integrated Daraja API for M-PESA payments and REST APIs for real-time inventory.

### 🎒 FindIt – Campus Lost & Found App  
A Firebase-Supabase powered app for students to report and recover lost items. Features include smart notifications, real-time listings, and a clean Flutter-based UI.

### 📰 The UoK Times – Campus News Blog  
Founded and manage a digital news platform for students at the University of Kabianga. 50+ articles published, 4,000+ readers reached.

### 🙏 Church Management System *(In Progress)*  
This project develops a web-based member registration system for a Catholic Church. It features a responsive and interactive frontend form designed for ease of use, coupled with a robust backend for secure data storage and management. The system aims to streamline the process of collecting member details, including personal, sacramental, and associational information.  

Key Features:

Frontend: Responsive design, dynamic header and hamburger menu, image slider, and comprehensive client-side form validation with real-time feedback. It includes dynamic fields for children's names (based on marital status) and a conditionally visible Small Christian Community (SCC) selection.
Backend (Planned): Will use PHP and MySQL to securely receive, validate, sanitize, and store registration data.
Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (frontend); PHP, MySQL/MongoDB (backend); XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP and phpMyAdmin (development tools).

Setup: Involves cloning the repo, installing a local server like XAMPP, setting up the database in phpMyAdmin, and configuring backend connections.

Usage: Users access the registration.html form, fill details with real-time validation, and submit. Data will be stored in the database.

Future plans include an admin dashboard, authentication, and deployment.
